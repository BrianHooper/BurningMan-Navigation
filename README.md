# BurningMan-Navigation

The program BurningMan-Navigation provides directions to various Burning Man landmarks relative to the users current GPS coordinates. The landmarks can be camps, bathroom locations, or art pieces.

Directions are provided in the form of distance in feet, a cardinal (east-west) direction, and a bearing (compass direction).

For example, the program can be used to find how to get to the nearest bathroom, or what direction to go to get back to your camp.

This project is currently in an early state, and is meant to be used on a small form-factor device such as a raspberry pi with a GPS module.
