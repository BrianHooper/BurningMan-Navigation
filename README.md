# BurningMan-Navigation

![](screenshot.png)

The program BurningMan-Navigation provides directions to various Burning Man landmarks relative to the users current GPS coordinates. The landmarks can be camps, bathroom locations, or art pieces. User interaction is provided using the keyboard or mouse, and most navigation can be completed using a touch-screen. The application also provides functionality for storing favorite locations (based off of either the current location or manually entered addresses), measuring distances, storing notes, and viewing stored events such as music or workshops. 

Directions are provided in the form of distance in feet, a cardinal (east-west) direction, and a bearing (compass direction).

For example, the program can be used to find how to get to the nearest bathroom, or what direction to go to get back to your camp.
