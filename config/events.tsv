Those brave (and foolish) enough to suit up will be encouraged to take a turn in the ring and let their inner show person shine. Prior to their match, wrestlers will be given an opportunity to select their own Luchador mascara and choose their wrestler name, persona and finishing move (after being fitted by our Luchadors in one of our many pairs of multi-sized crutches, always a hilarious crowd pleaser.) Our camp will be host to a plethora of beautiful Latin American cultural displays, including a traditional ofrenda that will serve as the launch point for a procession to the temple. On procession day burners of all ages will be invited to paint their faces in the tradition of Muertos and join the parade. New in 2019, our cantina will host daily folk art creation, lead by our wrestlers. Additionally, our cantina will provide a shaded siesta area equipped with hammocks for drowsy participants and an evening fire. We are very excited to offer for the first time, our 24ft. Tower De Fanaticos, a place to climb for a better view, cheer, take photos and enjoy the festivities. Also contributing to the growth of participation, as in prior years, the camp has planned several semi spontaneous evening events including, Kissadillas and Hots and Shots plus space for pop-ups to gift. Our builder will be hosting a series of lectures on designing and building Casitas (tiny houses), as well as sharing his architectural plans for one of his own design as a gift to participants who are interested. Our artist in residence will be displaying several large panels of their work that will be live painted at an art and fire festival prior to the burn on the perimeter of the camp.

And hopefully your team will be better at math than that, as you play the roles of scientists, defending Black Rock City against the imprecise scourge of philosophy! Or possibly bugs. But secretly, you aim to dominate the city yourself and spread your “Manicfesto” as you assemble the Ultimate Weapon, a 3D “device” assembled from pieces scattered at participating camps across the city. You’ll solve puzzles, go on wacky quests, play immersive games, and precipitate your ambitions. Every successful accomplishment gains you a degree along the Tenure Track, from undergraduate to Emeritus, and ownership of a block on the big board of Black Rock, a lasercut map of our favorite dusty city. Who will spread their Manicfesto block by block from Esplanade to the airport? The maddest scientists with the strongest duct tape, of course! A Mentor will run the game in camp from noon to 3pm every day to assign quests, confirm successful completions, bestow degrees, and spread each team’s Manicfesto onto the BRC map. Teams (or individuals) can pursue quests throughout the city all day and night, however! Participants get to keep their assembled “device” (or the pieces if they get too distracted to finish) and degrees as permanent mementos of how close they came to world domination. And a drink to lament the same.

The Alchemy Game uses practical aspects of ceremony and stirs it up in extreme interaction. To begin, the Witch opens the circle by calling in the four directions, the earth and cosmos. The Witch leads a brief meditation to drop everyone into a similar frequency. Participants are invited to identify an element (earth, air, fire, water) that embodies what they are “working on at this time.” The alchemy game unfolds as the groups move around the Medicine Wheel of elements, creating together an expanding, playful expression of their Work. Finally we charge up and seal our Medicine Wheel with a Transformation Celebration in movement and sound. bio: Sherry Aliberti, a multidisciplinary artist in Bend, OR works as an architect by trade and a witchy shamanic artist by heart. Her blessings and facilitations use crystals, soundscapes and movement. She channels games for groups to play with magic and manifestation.

I have been practicing with a partner for almost 2 years but, since I wasn’t able to practice countless hours a day with him, I found myself using a ballet barre, or a wall as my “partner”. Several months into practicing at a barre, I had a eureka moment— doing it by myself took on an entirely new form of movement. I was able to practice my embellishments without relying on my partner, and in doing so “Tango at the barre” was born I’ve choreographed a three minute dance that represents what a caterpillar emerging out of its cocoon, and becoming a butterfly would look like-The path to enlightenment is never an easy one. This dance represents not only the caterpillar’s fight to evolve—but all of ours. Set to the whimsical music of Solo Tango Orchestra’s El Hurucan, this piece will represent the birth of Mariposita. Sunset Monday, Tuesday And Wednesday. I will also spend some time teaching anyone who would like to learn some of the movements after the dance.

But secretly, you aim to dominate the city yourself and spread your “Manicfesto” as you assemble the Ultimate Weapon, a 3D “device” assembled from pieces scattered at participating camps across the city. You’ll solve puzzles, go on wacky quests, play immersive games, and precipitate your ambitions. Every successful accomplishment gains you a degree along the Tenure Track, from undergraduate to Emeritus, and ownership of a block on the big board of Black Rock, a lasercut map of our favorite dusty city. Who will spread their Manicfesto block by block from Esplanade to the airport? The maddest scientists with the strongest duct tape, of course! A Mentor will run the game in camp from noon to 3pm every day to assign quests, confirm successful completions, bestow degrees, and spread each team’s Manicfesto onto the BRC map. Teams (or individuals) can pursue quests throughout the city all day and night, however! Participants get to keep their assembled “device” (or the pieces if they get too distracted to finish) and degrees as permanent mementos of how close they came to world domination. And a drink to lament the same.

A taiko drummer provides drama, and there's always one or two ball wranglers on hand to help participants in and out. Couples Counseling, in which two people wearing giant balls (could be more if they're from Poly Paradise!!) try to knock some sense into their partner, with some very non-PC advice being shouted at them by our trained counselors from a bullhorn. Running of the Balls: Each day's activities end with two running games, during which six angry balls are released from our corral into a crowd of red-bandanna-wearing runners. Course flag waivers are positioned around the nearby plaza, and the runners must complete the course and try to survive by not getting knocked down.

I have been practicing with a partner for almost 2 years but, since I wasn’t able to practice countless hours a day with him, I found myself using a ballet barre, or a wall as my “partner”. Several months into practicing at a barre, I had a eureka moment— doing it by myself took on an entirely new form of movement. I was able to practice my embellishments without relying on my partner, and in doing so “Tango at the barre” was born I’ve choreographed a three minute dance that represents what a caterpillar emerging out of its cocoon, and becoming a butterfly would look like-The path to enlightenment is never an easy one. This dance represents not only the caterpillar’s fight to evolve—but all of ours. Set to the whimsical music of Solo Tango Orchestra’s El Hurucan, this piece will represent the birth of Mariposita. Sunset Monday, Tuesday And Wednesday. I will also spend some time teaching anyone who would like to learn some of the movements after the dance.

Sk8 yoga is also a huge part of lessons and we will do some stretching in the beginning and afterwords to keep ourselves properly skateboarding to the best of our abilities.

How to Roast Coffee Beans (in Silicon Village)	M.U.S.E.	Class/Workshop	['Wednesday, August 28th, 2019, 10 AM – 11 AM ']	Anyone can drink coffee, but how to Roast Coffee Beans for that Ultimate Satisfying cup of Joe is this class. The green coffee bean is actually the seed from a flower and tree which is processed and dried. Roasting coffee beans is simple, yet it takes a little practice…just like everything else…in order to perfect it. There are programmable roasters which make the whole process as simple as turning a dial and pressing a couple of buttons. These start at a little more than a hundred dollars and go up from there. The “Whirley Pop” which I will demonstrate here costs around $40. This air roasting method works like popping popcorn. There is a hand crank which turns a small metal paddle and keeps the beans moving so that they do not overheat and burn. You’ll also need a measuring cup to measure ½ cup of the beans and a large metal bowl to allow the beans to cool off and degas. Taught by the bean master himself, Pacer.

And hopefully your team will be better at math than that, as you play the roles of scientists, defending Black Rock City against the imprecise scourge of philosophy! Or possibly bugs. But secretly, you aim to dominate the city yourself and spread your “Manicfesto” as you assemble the Ultimate Weapon, a 3D “device” assembled from pieces scattered at participating camps across the city. You’ll solve puzzles, go on wacky quests, play immersive games, and precipitate your ambitions. Every successful accomplishment gains you a degree along the Tenure Track, from undergraduate to Emeritus, and ownership of a block on the big board of Black Rock, a lasercut map of our favorite dusty city. Who will spread their Manicfesto block by block from Esplanade to the airport? The maddest scientists with the strongest duct tape, of course! A Mentor will run the game in camp from noon to 3pm every day to assign quests, confirm successful completions, bestow degrees, and spread each team’s Manicfesto onto the BRC map. Teams (or individuals) can pursue quests throughout the city all day and night, however! Participants get to keep their assembled “device” (or the pieces if they get too distracted to finish) and degrees as permanent mementos of how close they came to world domination.

Auditory Festival Survival Guide with Miche naziri	Hello, We Love you!	Class/Workshop	['Wednesday, August 28th, 2019, 12 PM – 1 PM ']	Learn what low bass music is doing to your mind, body, and ears and how to protect your hearing! This concept was brought to my attention after attending endless EDM-centered music festivals and noticing the sensation I was experiencing, specifically from the subs. The sound of my entire body shaking and feeling my intestines from the inside. It's an experience that makes the EDM experience interactive but I also wondered what exactly are the aftereffects of this sound onto the mind, body, and ears. So, I took it upon myself to interview some of the most prestigious R&D audio engineers, Front of House/ Monitor Engineers, Audiologists, and System technicians to discover what these affects are and what professionals are doing to help alleviate these symptoms as well as what an average attendee can do to protect their hearing. In this workshop, you will learn a bit about the frequency and decibel range, how every person hears differently in this world, the loudness wars, what happens to your mind, body, and ears, and what you can do to protect your hearing. In the USA, we do not have any auditory regulations or education on what happens to our ears. By attending this workshop, you are expanding your horizons and education to elongate your festival experiences for many years to come.

A cat cafe. You know, those cafes where adoptable cats charm, delight, and annoy you while you are sipping a cold beverage?

After the metamorphosis from Human to Space Cat in our SPACE CAT SOUNDBATH (11:30am), our new feline friends are invited to take part in our Space Cat Cafe with us. You know, flick their tails around and arch their backs, get used to their new physical forms. Thai iced tea and treats will be served to humans and spacecats alike.

It's the playa, who knows?!?!?!?! If you're lucky, you'll be at our cafe when Mac and Joon are on-site with their INFORMATION/INTUITION BOOTH. Have a question? Participants who approach the booth will be given the choice between Information from Mac who will be present with books and a myriad of facts OR they can select Joon to intuit an answer. She will meditate and offer them a response. Answers may not be available at this time, answers may be too personal to get a clear read, or answers may come spontaneously. Participants will be advised well and approached with both humor and depth. Mac and Joon intend to bring a balance between Science and the Mystical.

The Alchemy Game uses practical aspects of ceremony and stirs it up in extreme interaction. To begin, the Witch opens the circle by calling in the four directions, the earth and cosmos. The Witch leads a brief meditation to drop everyone into a similar frequency. Participants are invited to identify an element (earth, air, fire, water) that embodies what they are “working on at this time.” The alchemy game unfolds as the groups move around the Medicine Wheel of elements, creating together an expanding, playful expression of their Work. Finally we charge up and seal our Medicine Wheel with a Transformation Celebration in movement and sound. bio: Sherry Aliberti, a multidisciplinary artist in Bend, OR works as an architect by trade and a witchy shamanic artist by heart. Her blessings and facilitations use crystals, soundscapes and movement. She channels games for groups to play with magic and manifestation. It is a Ritual at rainbow cosmic frequency that 5d expands with each participant. --

Either within our wooden corral or out on the street, two participants square off in a circle, each wearing a giant inflatable ball. Matches usually last only a minute, as the balls get knocked over and roll out of the ring. A taiko drummer provides drama, and there's always one or two ball wranglers on hand to help participants in and out. Couples Counseling, in which two people wearing giant balls (could be more if they're from Poly Paradise!!) try to knock some sense into their partner, with some very non-PC advice being shouted at them by our trained counselors from a bullhorn. Running of the Balls: Each day's activities end with two running games, during which six angry balls are released from our corral into a crowd of red-bandanna-wearing runners. Course flag waivers are positioned around the nearby plaza, and the runners must complete the course and try to survive by not getting knocked down.

Breathwork and Bungees	Yabba Dabba Do Me	Ritual/Ceremony	['Wednesday, August 28th, 2019, 5:15 PM – 6:30 PM ']	Breathwork is a simple breathing technique that assists in processing trauma, developing healthier thought patterns, and creating a new perspective on old behavior. This two-stage rhythm helps calm the brain and allows participants to experience a more tangible connection to their bodies. This practice allows participants to become more aware of buried emotion and deep-seated trauma while identifying the necessary steps toward healing those wounds. Because breathwork doesn’t depend on conscious thought, it is able to successfully circumnavigate the defense mechanisms and roadblocks typically encountered during conventional talk therapy and, often after just one session, participants are able to see and feel the nurturing effects. Breathwork isn’t magic, though it sometimes can feel exactly that. This breathing techniques ultimately distracts the mind long enough to provide participants with a respite from its incessant chatter and desperation to “figure it all out.” Results vary from person to person, but most clients report a reduced level of anxiety, a sense of being consciously present and connected, and in many cases having had “a spiritual experience” — often for the very first time. Self-judgment is reduced, self-love is achieved, and most importantly, participants gain awareness that they have the power to generate the same sense of relief that they had previously only been able to find by using ineffective coping mechanisms.

Latihan - Tune in to yourself and others	Camp Contact	Class/Workshop	['Wednesday, August 28th, 2019, 6 PM – 7:30 PM ']	 I tune in. Inside myself. I let the music be a medium to go deeper, and listen to the movements that come. I follow them. I feel bodies around me. Some brushing, some asking. Some are exploring the limits of their own environments. Others want to connect. Briefly, longer. I meet some. I move away from others. I tune in the physical sensations. Learn to accept them and let go of stories that sometimes float through my mind. Coming back to the sensations. I feel bodies around me. I have grown to know them now. My tribe. I don’t know them all, or not so well. But I know the tribe. I love them and they love me. These sensations are saying – we accept you. And then when new movements arise, I move away. It is time to let go of the security the bodies provide, fly on my own, move into pure darkness and uncertainty. Not knowing where I am going on my own. Not knowing how long I will be alone for. And embracing it. Taking risks. Trusting. And before I know it, I encounter new bodies. More souls who want to go where I go, eager to connect if I desire. I couldn’t see them and they couldn’t see me. But by moving away I connected anew. Latihan is the practice of life. Of embracing instinct. Of embracing trust.

I have been practicing with a partner for almost 2 years but, since I wasn’t able to practice countless hours a day with him, I found myself using a ballet barre, or a wall as my “partner”. Several months into practicing at a barre, I had a eureka moment— doing it by myself took on an entirely new form of movement. I was able to practice my embellishments without relying on my partner, and in doing so “Tango at the barre” was born I’ve choreographed a three minute dance that represents what a caterpillar emerging out of its cocoon, and becoming a butterfly would look like-The path to enlightenment is never an easy one. This dance represents not only the caterpillar’s fight to evolve—but all of ours. Set to the whimsical music of Solo Tango Orchestra’s El Hurucan, this piece will represent the birth of Mariposita. Sunset Monday, Tuesday And Wednesday. I will also spend some time teaching anyone who would like to learn some of the movements after the dance.

All instructors are trained and certified by Pike to teach up to his standards and most importantly safety, saftey, safety. Skateboarding is also very emotionally therapeutic and a great way to work out things with yourself. Pike’s sk8 philosophy plays a huge role in learning to trust yourself and looking at the bigger picture. Sk8 yoga is also a huge part of lessons and we will do some stretching in the beginning and afterwords to keep ourselves properly skateboarding to the best of our abilities.

In various containers, we will uncover our fear stories and play with the ways we use control patterns unconsciously or compulsively to help us avoid feeling out of control, foolish, rejected, criticized, abandoned (or any other fear outcome). In becoming more aware of these patterns, we can shift from a security/control mindset to a learning/discovery mindset that allows us to be more present and authentic to the moment. Located at Dome 3.

You’ll solve puzzles, go on wacky quests, play immersive games, and precipitate your ambitions. Every successful accomplishment gains you a degree along the Tenure Track, from undergraduate to Emeritus, and ownership of a block on the big board of Black Rock, a lasercut map of our favorite dusty city. Who will spread their Manicfesto block by block from Esplanade to the airport? The maddest scientists with the strongest duct tape, of course! A Mentor will run the game in camp from noon to 3pm every day to assign quests, confirm successful completions, bestow degrees, and spread each team’s Manicfesto onto the BRC map. Teams (or individuals) can pursue quests throughout the city all day and night, however!

Beautiful Imperfections	Authenticamp	Class/Workshop	['Thursday, August 29th, 2019, 2 PM – 4 PM ']	As we began exploring our shadows and depths, we often found ourselves steeped in shame and judgment, leaving the work feeling dark and heavy. In our desire to lean into the discomfort and in fact change our perspective on the perceived heaviness, we came across these *Surprise!* quotes about shame by Brene Brown: Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self acceptance. If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame can't survive. Numb the dark and you numb the light. We decided to change the story and shine light on our shame by talking about it openly, and finding ways to laugh about it and bring levity to what was previously weighing us down. Join us as we create a soft, loving, and playful environment to share with radical self acceptance all the ways our inner critic tries to bring us down.

Revolution of hippies in USSR - talk&discussion	CAMP SIIL	Class/Workshop	['Thursday, August 29th, 2019, 3 PM – 4 PM ']	Yes, there were hippies in Soviet Union! Come and hear about the incredible history of this longlasting underground movement of peace, love, freedom & creativity. Driven by the years-long anthropological research and visual documentation, this talk & discussion takes you on a Sovietic time machine, pulling you right into the psychedelic underground of the Soviet hippies. Through the 1970s, a subcultural network often referred to as sistema (translates from Russian as the system) expanded across the urban Soviet Union, connecting likeminded people with a wayfaring lifestyle. Between one other, information about gathering places and music festivals was shared, as well as the addresses and phone numbers of other people who associated themselves with sistema. The emerging social network made it possible to travel to another city and immediately find social support and a place to stay. As the hippies often say: “They had their system, we had our own system.” What was their protest like? How did they access Western rock and got to play their own music? What got them high? How did the Soviet hippies look like? Who was their guru? Didn't the KGB beat them up? And ultimately, what are the lessons of the pacifist history of ex-Soviet region we may take on board now?

The Tibetans claim that these exercises activate and stimulate the seven key chakras that in turn stimulate all the glands of the endocrine system. The endocrine system is responsible for the body's overall functioning and aging process. This means that the Five Rites will affect the functioning of all your organs and systems, including the physical and energetic systems and that includes the aging process.

And hopefully your team will be better at math than that, as you play the roles of scientists, defending Black Rock City against the imprecise scourge of philosophy! Or possibly bugs. But secretly, you aim to dominate the city yourself and spread your “Manicfesto” as you assemble the Ultimate Weapon, a 3D “device” assembled from pieces scattered at participating camps across the city. You’ll solve puzzles, go on wacky quests, play immersive games, and precipitate your ambitions. Every successful accomplishment gains you a degree along the Tenure Track, from undergraduate to Emeritus, and ownership of a block on the big board of Black Rock, a lasercut map of our favorite dusty city. Who will spread their Manicfesto block by block from Esplanade to the airport? The maddest scientists with the strongest duct tape, of course! A Mentor will run the game in camp from noon to 3pm every day to assign quests, confirm successful completions, bestow degrees, and spread each team’s Manicfesto onto the BRC map. Teams (or individuals) can pursue quests throughout the city all day and night, however! Participants get to keep their assembled “device” (or the pieces if they get too distracted to finish) and degrees as permanent mementos of how close they came to world domination. And a drink to lament the same.

Cory Doctorow - Surveillance Capitalism Monopoly	8:30/E	Class/Workshop	['Friday, August 30th, 2019, 1 PM – 2:30 PM ']	Cory Doctorow Surveillance Capitalism is Monopoly Capitalism New Zealand's privacy commissioner calls Big Tech morally bankrupt liars. He's right. Everything that Big Tech claims about itself should be treated with suspicion -- including (especially) the marketing materials in which they claim that they can use surveillance to override our free will and convince us of any idea advertisers are willing to pay to spread. Big Tech *does* control our choices: by holding our friends hostage in their walled gardens, by using software locks to prevent us from choosing whose software we run or where we get our gadgets fixed, and by controlling the discourse by dominating search and recommendation. We can choose to fix Big Tech -- by subjecting them to the kinds of expensive regulations that only the biggest companies can afford -- or we can choose to fix the internet -- by breaking up Big Tech into manageable pieces, which will not be able to afford to police their users for terrorism, harassment, extremism, copyright infringement, etc. But we can't do both. Better to have a free, fair and open internet than to drape golden chains around Big Tech and hope that they never outgrow them.

Native Americans believe that the night air is filled with dreams, both good and bad. When hung above the bed in a place where the morning sunlight can hit it, the dream catcher attracts all sorts of dreams and thoughts into its webs. Good dreams pass through and gently slide down the feathers to the sleeper below while bad dreams are caught in its protective net and destroyed, burned up in the light of day.

Is it exciting...confusing...and maybe a little bit scary? This pegging workshop is open to everyone but tailored to female-identifying humans. Regardless of the anatomy with which you were born, sticking things in your ass feels good. In fact, prostate stimulation can produce orgasms up to 10 times stronger and/or more intense than an average genital-stimulation-only O. Pegging is about pleasure—plain and simple—and humans are enjoying ass play and pegging without shame or stigma now more than ever. Pegging need not be about dominating, humiliating, or degrading your partner if you don’t want it to be. I have my own personal style and so will you. Join me as we leave our fears behind and explore safe pegging techniques and beginner equipment. This workshop includes an interactive demonstration, Q&A, and a few surprises.

Course flag waivers are positioned around the nearby plaza, and the runners must complete the course and try to survive by not getting knocked down.

Tiny Dirty Secret Burn	Tiny Dirty Secret	Fire	['Friday, August 30th, 2019, 11:45 PM – 1:45 AM ']	Come enjoy the best and most magnificent burn on the playa. This year, a very different type of burn is happening. Tiny Dirty Secret is the third installment of a trifecta of art pieces. Little Dirty Secret in 2017 and Big Dirty Secret in 2018. Rather than going big, it's going to be the smallest burn in Burning Man history. Don't be confused by the smallest burn being something that isn't that cool, because that isn't the case. In fact, it's going to be a really badass fireworks show, a great colored fire that will impress most, and gas mines to excite even a seasoned pyro!. It is sure to be a spectacle you don't want to miss! The reason behind this is some of the big pieces of Art are as big as some people's Egos. Not that there is no love for the big art, but this year it will be shown that even a small piece can be as badass as ever and a big Ego can be left at the door. Bye Felicia! So this is the callout for all of you to come and enjoy a fun burn, that means YOU!. Friday night at 11: 59 p.m burn time, come early and get a front row seat! Mark it on your calendars, show up and support something great! Find TDS on the playa during the week and fill out a Dirty Secret card, drop it in the slot. This is a way to anonymously let go and lift the burdens and secrets you hide within. These are things that weigh us down and hold us back from living life we want. Come release yourself, and let go of that shit! Also, bring your Mutant Vehicle, Fire Spinning awesomeness and help the cause, the more the merrier! See You at the Burn!

Main Event: Running of the Balls. Two running games beginning at 5:30 pm All events feature gifts of red bandannas and chilled sangria. Giant Ball Sumo can happen at any time, and often does. Either within our wooden corral or out on the street, two participants square off in a circle, each wearing a giant inflatable ball. Matches usually last only a minute, as the balls get knocked over and roll out of the ring. A taiko drummer provides drama, and there's always one or two ball wranglers on hand to help participants in and out. Couples Counseling, in which two people wearing giant balls (could be more if they're from Poly Paradise!!) try to knock some sense into their partner, with some very non-PC advice being shouted at them by our trained counselors from a bullhorn. Running of the Balls: Each day's activities end with two running games, during which six angry balls are released from our corral into a crowd of red-bandanna-wearing runners. Course flag waivers are positioned around the nearby plaza, and the runners must complete the course and try to survive by not getting knocked down.

Last Burner Standing	Yabba Dabba Do Me	Game	['Saturday, August 31st, 2019, 5 PM – 6:30 PM ']	Our camps main attraction is a trampoline suspended from a giant web of bungee cords. The tramp will move in a multitude of directions, and is very reactive to the movements of those who are on it. It will swing, tilt, bounce, gyrate, jiggle, and even rotate in a huge circle. Every action has a reaction, and every motion has an emotion. When burners first enter our dome, they're not quite sure what they are looking at. Climbing a single scaffolding allows entry through the bungee wall, and onto the trampoline. The first impulse is to jump, it's a trampoline after all. But the jump is not what's this is all about. The tramp will shift around in reaction to the participants movements. The first thing that happens, is everyone falls down. Then they start laughing.The braver ones will get up and start moving around. This causes more chaos, and everyone ends up in a big pile. Once again, the more adventurous ones get up again, and this time, they start to figure it out. Jump around, and try to make the others fall. The game is on, and the last one standing wins. We've done this at all hours, and the most hilarious are at dawn, after a long night out when you are most wobbly anyway. Feel free to come by any time for practice runs. We would schedule this for that hour, but we never know who will actually be up then. So we've decided to schedule this for Saturday afternoon, when the week is winding down, and everyone is truly burned. It's a great way to end your burn.
