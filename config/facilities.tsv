Art placement will be modified to accommodate this zone.This zone allows for a longer stay — up to 12 hours — and it provides sanitary stations and Emergency Services medical personnel at this fixed site. The area is large enough for several vehicles to occupy the zone. Their speakers must be turned out and away from the city. The restriction of no “encampments” still applies: no camping or setting up speakers or other type of structures on the ground. Of course, Leave No Trace practices must be employed.
